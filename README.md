# MYTF1 Plex Plugin
A Plugin for [Plex Media Server](http://plex.tv) to watch replays from [MYTF1](http://tf1.fr)


## Installation

You can install it using the [instructions](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-) provided by Plex


## Thanks

- [FReplay](https://github.com/spmjc/plugin.video.freplay) XBMC addon for the auth process with wat.tv
- TF1 for doing a sh*tty iOS app full of ads and without the possibility to diffuse it on the Chromecast
- Quotidien, the one and only emission I want to watch on TV
